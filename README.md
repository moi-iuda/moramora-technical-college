# moramora-technical-college
This project aims to develop a website for the MoraMora Technical College located in the West New Britain Province. 
The website to be developed will become the platform for the institution to publish and inform prospective students 
and relevant stakeholders of vital information about the institution, the programmes it offers and post the latest 
developments from the institution.
